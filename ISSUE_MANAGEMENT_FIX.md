# Issue Management Workflow Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The unified issue management workflow was not processing 43 pending issue update files in `.github/issue-updates/` directory, resulting in only 5 GitHub issues instead of expected 20-30+ issues.

## Root Cause

The workflow configuration had a circular reference:

```yaml
# BEFORE (problematic):
uses: jdfalk/ghcommon/.github/workflows/reusable-unified-issue-management.yml@main
```

This caused the workflow to try to call itself remotely, creating a circular dependency that prevented execution.

## Solution Applied

Fixed the workflow to use a local relative path:

```yaml
# AFTER (working):
uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-unified-issue-management.yml
```

## Expected Results

When this PR is merged to main branch:

1. **Automatic Processing**: Push to main will trigger the workflow
2. **Backlog Processing**: All 43 pending JSON files will be processed
3. **Issue Creation**: 20-30+ GitHub issues will be created from the backlog
4. **Future Automation**: Subsequent pushes to main will automatically process new issue files

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/issue-management.yml` - Fixed circular reference
- `.github/issue-updates/workflow-trigger-test.json` - Added trigger file to force processing

## Verification Steps

1. Merge this PR to main
2. Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow execution
3. Verify new issues are created from JSON files
4. Confirm processed files are moved to `processed/` directory

## Technical Details

- Workflow triggers on pushes to main that modify `.github/issue-updates/**` paths
- Uses `scripts/issue_manager.py` to process JSON files
- Creates GitHub issues, comments, and updates based on JSON actions
- Includes duplicate prevention and comprehensive logging
