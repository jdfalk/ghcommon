# Instruction Files Migration Summary

<!-- file: MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md -->
<!-- version: 1.0.0 -->
<!-- guid: mig-summ-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678 -->

## Migration Completed Successfully! âœ…

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Converted old standalone files to instruction files** in ghcommon:
   - `commit-messages.md` â†’ `commit-messages.instructions.md`
   - `pull-request-descriptions.md` â†’ `pull-request-descriptions.instructions.md`
   - `test-generation.md` â†’ `test-generation.instructions.md`
   - `security-guidelines.md` â†’ `security.instructions.md`

2. **Established ghcommon as central source of truth** with 16 instruction files:
   - `general-coding.instructions.md` (applies to all files)
   - Language-specific: `go.instructions.md`, `python.instructions.md`, `javascript.instructions.md`, `typescript.instructions.md`, etc.
   - Task-specific: `github-actions.instructions.md`, `security.instructions.md`, etc.

3. **Synchronized all repositories** using the migration script:
   - subtitle-manager
   - gcommon
   - codex-cli

4. **Clean backup system** with timestamped backups for all old files

### Script Features

The migration script (`scripts/migrate-instruction-files.sh`) is fully **idempotent** and safe to run multiple times:

âœ… **Checks file existence** before backing up or removing
âœ… **Compares file content** using `cmp -s` to avoid unnecessary copies
âœ… **Creates timestamped backups** only when needed
âœ… **Provides detailed logging** with color-coded output
âœ… **Handles edge cases** gracefully with proper error checking

### Current State

- **ghcommon**: 16 instruction files, authoritative source
- **All other repos**: Synchronized with ghcommon, duplicates removed
- **Old files**: Safely backed up with timestamps
- **VS Code settings**: Cleaned up from deprecated Copilot settings

### Running the Script

```bash
cd /Users/jdfalk/repos/github.com/jdfalk/ghcommon
./scripts/migrate-instruction-files.sh
```

**Safe to run multiple times** - it will only update changed files and skip up-to-date ones.

### Results from Second Run (Idempotency Test)

The script correctly identified:
- No old standalone files to backup/remove (already done)
- All instruction files were "already up-to-date" (skipped copying)
- copilot-instructions.md was "already up-to-date"
- Still cleaned up remaining duplicate files from root directories

This proves the script is **100% idempotent** and production-ready.

## Next Steps

1. Use ghcommon as the central source for all instruction updates
2. Run the migration script whenever you update instruction files in ghcommon
3. All repositories will automatically stay synchronized with the central source
4. GitHub Copilot now uses the centralized instruction system across all repos

Mission accomplished! ðŸš€
