# Task 03 Part 6: Troubleshooting and Task Completion

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "missing field" Errors

**Symptom:**

```text
error: failed to publish to registry at ...
caused by: missing field `authors` in Cargo.toml
```

**Cause:**

Cargo.toml is missing required fields for publishing.

**Solution:**

Add all required fields to `[package]` section:

```toml
[package]
name = "your-crate"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
authors = ["Your Name <email@example.com>"]
description = "A clear, concise description of your crate"
license = "MIT"  # or "Apache-2.0", "BSD-3-Clause", etc.
repository = "https://github.com/owner/repo"
```

**Validation script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check for all required fields
REQUIRED=("name" "version" "edition" "authors" "description" "license" "repository")
for field in "${REQUIRED[@]}"; do
  if ! grep -q "^$field =" Cargo.toml; then
    echo "Missing: $field"
  fi
done
```

### Issue 2: Authentication Failures

**Symptom:**

```text
error: failed to publish to registry
caused by: denied: permission_denied: write_package
```

**Cause:**

Token doesn't have `packages:write` permission.

**Solution 1: Check Workflow Permissions**

```bash
# Verify workflow has correct permissions in the job
grep -A 3 "permissions:" .github/workflows/release-rust.yml

# Should include:
# permissions:
#   contents: read
#   packages: write
```

**Solution 2: Check Repository Settings**

1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
2. Under "Workflow permissions":
   - Select "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
3. Click "Save"

**Solution 3: Use PAT with Correct Scopes**

```bash
# Create PAT at https://github.com/settings/tokens with scopes:
# - write:packages
# - read:packages
# - repo (if private repository)

# Add as repository secret named CARGO_PAT
# Update workflow to use it:
env:
  CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CARGO_PAT }}
```

### Issue 3: "crate already exists" Error

**Symptom:**

```text
error: crate version `0.1.0` is already uploaded
```

**Cause:**

Trying to publish a version that already exists.

**Solution:**

This is expected behavior! The workflow includes a check for this:

```yaml
- name: Check if version already published
  id: check-published
  # ... checks for existing version ...

- name: Publish crate
  if: steps.check-published.outputs.already-published != 'true'
  # ... only publishes if version is new ...
```

**If check isn't working:**

```bash
# Manually check if version exists
gh api repos/owner/repo/packages/cargo/crate-name/versions \
  --jq '.[].name' | grep "^0.1.0$"

# If exists, bump version in Cargo.toml
```

### Issue 4: Tag and Version Mismatch

**Symptom:**

```text
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Git tag (1.2.3) doesn't match Cargo.toml version (1.2.2)
```

**Cause:**

Git tag version and Cargo.toml version are out of sync.

**Solution:**

**Option 1: Fix Cargo.toml**

```bash
# Update Cargo.toml to match tag
sed -i 's/^version = .*/version = "1.2.3"/' Cargo.toml
git add Cargo.toml
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.3"
git push

# Delete and recreate tag
git tag -d v1.2.3
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.2.3
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

**Option 2: Fix Tag**

```bash
# Update tag to match Cargo.toml
git tag -d v1.2.3
git tag v1.2.2  # Match Cargo.toml version
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.2
```

**Prevention:**

Use a pre-commit hook to verify version consistency:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# file: .git/hooks/pre-commit
# version: 1.0.0

CARGO_VERSION=$(grep -m1 '^version =' Cargo.toml | sed 's/version = "\(.*\)"/\1/')
GIT_TAG=$(git describe --tags --exact-match 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^v//')

if [ -n "$GIT_TAG" ] && [ "$CARGO_VERSION" != "$GIT_TAG" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Version mismatch!"
  echo "Cargo.toml: $CARGO_VERSION"
  echo "Git tag: $GIT_TAG"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Issue 5: Registry Index Not Found

**Symptom:**

```text
error: registry `github` not found
```

**Cause:**

Cargo configuration is missing or incorrect.

**Solution:**

Verify `.cargo/config.toml` is created correctly:

```bash
# Check if file exists and has correct content
cat ~/.cargo/config.toml

# Should contain:
# [registries.github]
# index = "sparse+https://api.github.com/owner/repo/cargo/"
```

**If missing in CI:**

Check the workflow step that creates the config:

```yaml
- name: Configure Cargo for GitHub Registry
  run: |
    mkdir -p ~/.cargo
    cat > ~/.cargo/config.toml << EOF
    [registries.github]
    index = "sparse+https://api.github.com/${{ github.repository }}/cargo/"
    EOF
```

### Issue 6: Package Not Searchable After Publishing

**Symptom:**

```text
‚ö†Ô∏è Package published but not yet searchable
```

**Cause:**

GitHub Package Registry indexing takes time (usually 1-5 minutes).

**Solution:**

This is normal and not an error. The workflow handles this gracefully:

```yaml
- name: Verify publication
  run: |
    for i in {1..5}; do
      # Try to fetch package
      if curl -s ... | jq ...; then
        echo "‚úÖ Package verified"
        exit 0
      fi
      sleep 10
    done
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Package published but not yet searchable (this is normal)"
```

**Manual verification:**

```bash
# Wait a few minutes, then check
gh api repos/owner/repo/packages/cargo/crate-name

# Or check in browser
open https://github.com/owner/repo/packages
```

### Issue 7: Cargo Build Fails During Publish

**Symptom:**

```text
error: failed to verify package tarball
caused by: failed to compile `crate-name`
```

**Cause:**

Package build fails during verification (usually due to missing files or platform-specific code).

**Solution:**

**Option 1: Use `--no-verify` Flag** (Recommended)

```yaml
cargo publish --registry github --no-verify
```

Justification: The `build-rust` job already verified the build works on all platforms. Re-verifying during publish is redundant and can fail on cross-compilation edge cases.

**Option 2: Fix Build Issues**

```bash
# Test package locally
cargo package --list  # Check what's included
cargo package         # Build .crate file
cd target/package/crate-name-0.1.0
cargo build          # Test if package builds
```

**Common causes:**

- Missing files in package (excluded by .gitignore)
- Platform-specific code without proper cfg flags
- Path dependencies not resolved

**Fix exclusions in Cargo.toml:**

```toml
[package]
include = [
    "src/**/*",
    "Cargo.toml",
    "README.md",
    "LICENSE",
]
```

## Debugging Techniques

### Enable Debug Logging

Add verbose logging to workflow:

```yaml
- name: Publish crate (debug mode)
  env:
    CARGO_LOG: debug
    CARGO_HTTP_DEBUG: true
  run: |
    cargo publish \
      --registry github \
      --verbose \
      --allow-dirty \
      --no-verify
```

### Inspect API Responses

Add debugging to API calls:

```yaml
- name: Check package (debug)
  run: |
    # Save full response
    curl -v \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
      -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
      "https://api.github.com/orgs/${{ github.repository_owner }}/packages/cargo/$CRATE_NAME" \
      > /tmp/package-debug.json 2>&1

    # Show response
    cat /tmp/package-debug.json
```

### Dry Run Testing

Test publish locally without actually publishing:

```bash
# Full dry run (includes build verification)
cargo publish --dry-run

# Dry run without verification (faster)
cargo publish --dry-run --no-verify

# Check what would be uploaded
cargo package --list
```

### Workflow Debugging

Enable workflow debugging:

```bash
# Set repository secrets:
ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG=true
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true

# Then re-run workflow
gh workflow run release.yml
```

View debug logs:

```bash
# Download logs with debug info
gh run view <run-id> --log > workflow-debug.log

# Search for specific issues
grep -i "error\|fail\|debug" workflow-debug.log
```

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Use `--no-verify` for CI Publishing**
   - Redundant verification wastes time
   - Can fail on cross-compilation edge cases
   - Build job already validates everything

2. **Check for Existing Versions**
   - Prevents duplicate publish errors
   - Provides clear user feedback
   - Makes workflow idempotent

3. **Validate Cargo.toml Early**
   - Fail fast if required fields missing
   - Provide helpful error messages
   - Guide users to fix issues

4. **Use Dynamic Configuration**
   - `${{ github.repository }}` for registry URL
   - Works for any repository using workflow
   - No hardcoded values

5. **Handle Indexing Delays**
   - Retry with backoff
   - Don't treat delays as errors
   - Provide helpful messages

### Process Lessons

   - Use `cargo publish --dry-run`
   - Verify Cargo.toml completeness
   - Check package contents

2. **Test with Pre-Release Versions**
   - Use `-test.1`, `-rc.1` suffixes
   - Don't pollute main version space
   - Easy to delete if issues found

3. **Document Prerequisites**
   - List required Cargo.toml fields
   - Explain authentication
   - Provide troubleshooting guide

4. **Provide Clear Feedback**
   - Use emojis for visual clarity (üì¶, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå)
   - Show detailed steps in logs
   - Create summary in Actions UI

5. **Make Workflow Defensive**
   - Check for edge cases
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Provide recovery instructions
