Fixed critical workflow validation error where GITHUB_TOKEN was declared as a secret
in workflow_call, which conflicts with GitHub Actions reserved token names.

Issues Addressed:

fix(protobuf-generation): remove GITHUB_TOKEN secret declaration
- Removed GITHUB_TOKEN from secrets section in workflow_call
- GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically available in all workflows
- Fixed "secret name `GITHUB_TOKEN` within `workflow_call` can not be used since it would collide with system reserved name" error
- Updated workflow version to reflect the fix

Result: Workflow files now validate successfully without GITHUB_TOKEN collision errors.
The token remains automatically available via ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} in all workflow steps."""
