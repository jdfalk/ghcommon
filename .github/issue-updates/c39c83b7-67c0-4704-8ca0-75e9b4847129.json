  "body": "Fixed the reusable add-to-project workflow that was failing with 'Input required and not supplied: github-token' error.

## Problem
The `actions/add-to-project@v1.0.2` action was failing because the `github-token` input wasn't being properly supplied. The reusable workflow was trying to use `inputs.github-token || secrets.gh-token` but the input parameter was causing issues.

## Solution
- Removed the confusing `github-token` input parameter from the reusable workflow
- Modified the workflow to directly use `secrets.gh-token` 
- Simplified the token handling to use only the secret

## Impact
This fixes the add-to-project automation across all repositories using this reusable workflow:
- codex-cli
- subtitle-manager  
- gcommon
- ghcommon

The workflows will now successfully add issues and PRs to GitHub Projects automatically.",
