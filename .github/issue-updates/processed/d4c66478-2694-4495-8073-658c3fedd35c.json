  "body": "Goal: Refactor all CI/CD workflows in ghcommon to use a single, reusable workflow template for build, test, lint, and deploy.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- All major workflows (build, test, lint, deploy) are refactored to use a single reusable workflow file via 'workflow_call'.\n- All jobs use consistent environment setup, caching, and matrix strategies.\n- All secrets and environment variables are managed via repository/environment secrets.\n- Documentation is updated to describe the new workflow structure and how to add new jobs.\n- All legacy workflow files are removed or archived.\n\nTechnical Notes:\n- Use GitHub Actions 'reusable workflows' and 'workflow_call' for DRY principles.\n- Use matrix builds for OS, Python/Go versions, and dependency sets.\n- Ensure compatibility with self-hosted and GitHub-hosted runners.\n- Validate with dry-run and real PRs.\n- See .github/workflows/reusable-unified-issue-management.yml for reference.",
