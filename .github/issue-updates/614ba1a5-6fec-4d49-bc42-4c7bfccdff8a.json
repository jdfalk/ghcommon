🔄 Partial support:
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Failed operations don't affect successful ones (matrix strategy)
- Files remain in place if processing fails

❌ Still needed:
- Transaction support for multi-step operations
- Explicit rollback for partially completed operations
- State persistence for recovery

This aligns with TODO.md Phase 2 improvements. Should remain open.",
