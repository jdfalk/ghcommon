# TODO

## 🤖 Background Agent Queue (manage_todo_list sync)

- [ ] Plan security workflow actionization - Goal: Move security scanning logic
      out of reusable-security.yml into auditable composite actions with
      external scripts only. - Scope (initial action repos): -
      jdfalk/security-codeql-action: Orchestrate codeql init/analyze/upload
      (wraps actions/codeql) with repo config overrides. -
      jdfalk/security-trivy-action: Trivy filesystem/image/vulnerability scan
      with SARIF output and severity gating. - jdfalk/security-osv-scan-action:
      OSV-Scanner on repo dependencies (Go, Python, Node, Rust) with SARIF
      output. - jdfalk/security-secrets-action: Gitleaks (or repo-level secret
      scan wrapper) with allowlist support. - jdfalk/security-summary-action:
      Aggregate SARIFs, gate on thresholds, and write step summary +
      artifacts. - Inputs/Outputs (common): - Inputs: `paths`, `exclude`,
      `severity-threshold`, `fail-on`, `sarif-path`, `upload-sarif`
      (true/false), `tool-args`. - Outputs: `sarif`, `findings-count`,
      `critical-count`, `high-count`, `failed`. - Deliverables: - Each repo:
      action.yml, README with usage, src/ implementation (Python/Bash),
      .github/workflows/ci.yml tests. - Tags: v1.0.0 initial, moving tags v1 and
      v1.0, GitHub Release with changelog. - Docs: ghcommon
      ACTIONS_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md section for security actions + examples. -
      Acceptance Criteria: - Actions run on sample repos producing SARIF,
      respect thresholds, and publish summaries. - reusable-security.yml
      refactored to call these actions; dry-run passes in 2 representative
      repos. - Risks/Notes: Keep codeql on GH-hosted runners; avoid inline
      scripts; support matrix by language as needed.

- [ ] Audit remaining workflows for action conversion - Inventory Targets: -
      reusable-advanced-cache.yml → cache-strategy-action -
      reusable-maintenance.yml → maintenance-summary-action -
      reusable-protobuf.yml → protobuf-config-action, protobuf-verify-action (if
      not done) - documentation.yml → docs-generator-action -
      issue-automation.yml → intelligent-labeling-action - sync-receiver.yml →
      sync-receiver-action - Steps: - Build call graph from
      WORKFLOW_SCRIPT_USAGE_MAP.md to confirm dependencies. - Define action
      contracts (inputs/outputs) matching current scripts. - Draft action repos
      list, ownership, and rollout order (P1→P4). - Deliverables: Updated
      WORKFLOW_SCRIPT_AUDIT.md with status, risks, and ETA per action. -
      Acceptance Criteria: Signed-off actionization plan with sequencing and
      test strategy.

- [ ] Validate new composite actions CI/CD pipelines - Scope: Six
      already-created actions (load-config, ci-generate-matrices,
      detect-languages, release-strategy, generate-version, package-assets). -
      Tests to Run: - Lint/parse action.yml; run action unit tests via local
      workflow in each repo. - Integration: use minimal sample repos to execute
      typical paths and verify outputs + summaries. - Failure modes: missing
      configs, malformed inputs, matrix edge cases. - Observability: Ensure
      GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY is populated and outputs match docs exactly. -
      Deliverables: ACTIONS_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md updated with run IDs and
      pass/fail notes. - Acceptance Criteria: All action repos have green CI on
      main and successful integration runs.

- [ ] Verify action tags and releases (v1/v1.0/v1.0.0) - Tag Policy: - Create
      immutable v1.0.0 tags; create/update moving tags v1 and v1.0 to latest
      compatible. - Ensure GitHub Releases exist for v1.0.0 with notes mirroring
      README features and changes. - Steps: - List tags in each action repo;
      create missing moving tags; verify protection settings. - Confirm release
      metadata: title, body, links to example workflows, and compatibility
      notes. - Deliverables: Tag and Release checklist log per repo in ghcommon
      (logs/tags/...). - Acceptance Criteria: Consumers can pin @v1, @v1.0, or
      @v1.0.0 consistently; Marketplace visibility OK.

- [ ] Update reusable workflows to use new actions and verify - Targets:
      reusable-ci.yml (partially done), reusable-release.yml (partially done),
      reusable-security.yml (new), protobuf workflow (if applicable). - Steps: -
      Replace inline/scripted steps with uses: jdfalk/\*-action@v1. - Keep
      dorny/paths-filter where fit; remove sparse-checkout logic entirely. - Add
      summary checkpoints and robust outputs wiring between jobs. - Run on
      ghcommon (self) and audiobook-organizer as canary; capture run logs. -
      Deliverables: PR/commit diffs for each workflow; Integration Guide updated
      with before/after. - Acceptance Criteria: Green pipeline in canary repos;
      artifacts/releases intact; no inline scripts remain.

- [x] Roll out dockerized action paths + GHCR auto-publish workflows across
      suitable action repos. Status: COMPLETED (11/18 suitable repos).
      Dockerized: detect-languages-action, load-config-action,
      get-frontend-config-action, package-assets-action,
      ci-generate-matrices-action, auto-module-tagging-action,
      generate-version-action, release-docker-action, release-frontend-action,
      release-go-action, release-protobuf-action. Intentionally skipped 7
      actions: 2 release orchestrators (release-python-action,
      release-rust-action) require GitHub Actions ecosystem and external
      services; 5 embedded Python actions (ci-workflow-helpers-action,
      pr-auto-label-action, docs-generator-action, security-summary-action,
      release-strategy-action) would require significant refactoring for
      marginal benefit. Deliverables achieved: Dockerfile/.dockerignore,
      `use-docker`/`docker-image` inputs with docker/host branching,
      README/CHANGELOG/TODO updates, publish-docker workflow that builds/pushes
      GHCR, updates pinned digest in action.yml, commits and tags.

### Standardize Action Repo Workflows (ci.yml, release.yml, integration)

- ✅ COMPLETED (January 2, 2026)
- Scope: Every action repo gets consistent CI (lint + parse + minimal run),
  Release (tag + moving tags), and Integration (use action from tag in a sample
  run).
- Steps: - Add `ci.yml` with actionlint, yamllint, markdownlint,
  shellcheck/pyflakes as applicable; run an example job `uses: ./` and assert
  outputs. - Add `release.yml` to create vX.Y.Z, update vX and vX.Y, generate
  GitHub Release notes, attach example snippets. - Add `test-integration.yml` to
  `uses: owner/repo@v1` ensuring public consumption works.
- Deliverables: Workflow files across all action repos; status badges in README.
- Acceptance: All actions show green CI for push/PR; release workflow produces
  tags/releases.
- Completion Notes:
  - All 18 action repos have auto-merge.yml
  - 242 labels synced across all repos using sync-labels-fast.py
  - All repos have dependabot.yml configured
  - Created new point releases: 14 repos at v1.1.2, 4 repos at v1.0.1
  - Force-updated floating tags (v1, v1.0) to latest commits across all repos

### Security Hardening for Workflows

- ✅ COMPLETED (January 2, 2026)
- Scope: Apply least-privilege permissions, pin actions to SHAs or major
  versions, add security scanning.
- Steps: - Set `permissions` per job; default to `read` and escalate only when
  needed (contents, id-token, attestations, etc.). - Pin third-party actions
  (actionlint suggests), enable OIDC for publishing when applicable. - Add
  CodeQL or basic SAST for helper code; add Trivy for containers where relevant.
- Deliverables: Updated workflows with pinned actions, permissions, security
  checks documented.
- Progress:
  - ✅ Audited all external action dependencies across 18 repos
  - ✅ Fetched latest releases and commit SHAs for 15 external actions
  - ✅ Pinned all external actions to format: owner/action@FULL_SHA # vX.Y.Z
  - ✅ Updated 9 action repos with pinned hashes and pushed changes
  - ✅ Enabled "require SHA pinning" setting on 17 action repos via GitHub API
  - ✅ Deployed pre-commit hooks and linter configs to all 17 action repos
  - ✅ Tested pre-commit hooks in all 17 repos to verify clean execution
  - ✅ Fixed pre-commit config issues (yamllint and ruff paths) across all repos
  - ✅ Created .yamllint configuration files with standard rules in all repos
  - ✅ Committed linter auto-fixes (prettier, shfmt formatting) from pre-commit
    testing
  - ✅ Ensured all 18 repos have TODO.md and CHANGELOG.md with proper headers
    and templates
- Acceptance: No `warning: write-all` permissions; Dependabot alerts addressed
  for action pins.

### Documentation Completeness (READMEs, Inputs/Outputs, Examples)

- Scope: Ensure each action README includes inputs/outputs tables, examples for
  common and advanced usage, and links to reusable workflow examples.
- Steps: - Generate Inputs/Outputs from action.yml to markdown tables; add
  minimal and advanced examples. - Add badges: CI, Release, Marketplace (if
  applicable), Version tags. - Cross-link to ghcommon Integration Guide
  sections.
- Deliverables: Updated READMEs across all actions; docs PR linking strategy.
- Acceptance: Lint passes (markdownlint), and examples verified via integration
  workflow.

### End-to-End Validation in Example Consumer Repo(s)

- Scope: Create/refresh a small sample repo that consumes reusable-ci and
  reusable-release, and exercises new actions in realistic paths (Go, Python,
  Frontend variants).
- Steps: - Matrix run: Linux primary; optionally macOS/Windows smoke checks for
  action portability. - Trigger CI and Release flows; verify artifacts, tags,
  releases, and summaries. - Capture run IDs and logs; add to Verification
  Report.
- Deliverables: `example-consumer` results logged and referenced; issues filed
  for any regressions.
- Acceptance: Green end-to-end runs with artifacts/releases matching
  expectations.

### Backward Compatibility & Deprecation Plan

- Scope: Provide a safe migration off scripts to actions without breaking
  existing callers.
- Steps: - Keep current workflows working; introduce new action-powered paths
  under a feature flag window. - Emit warnings in summaries when legacy script
  path executed; set removal timeline. - Document migration steps and timelines
  in ghcommon.
- Deliverables: Deprecation notice, migration guide, feature flag defaults
  schedule.
- Acceptance: No hard breaks during migration window; consumers adopt new
  actions successfully.

### Governance & Protections

- Scope: Ensure changes to workflows/actions require appropriate review and pass
  required checks.
- Steps: - Update CODEOWNERS for `.github/workflows/**` and action repos; set
  required checks for merges. - Enforce branch protection rules and conventional
  commit checks. - Add PR templates for action repos with checklist (docs, tags,
  tests).
- Deliverables: Governance config updates across repos.
- Acceptance: Merges to main blocked without reviews + green checks; history
  clean via conventions.

### Org-wide Monitoring & Summaries

- Scope: Central visibility of runs, failures, tag creation, and adoption rate.
- Steps: - Extend workflow-debugger to include action repo CI health and
  tag/release verification. - Nightly job to aggregate status across repos and
  post summary artifact. - Track adoption of new actions by repository and
  workflow.
- Deliverables: Monitoring scripts/workflows and summary artifacts.
- Acceptance: Weekly status reports show CI health and adoption metrics.

### #todo 4. Standardize CI workflows across action repos

**Status:** Not Started **Priority:** High **Templates:** test-action.yml,
ci.yml (release-rust-action, release-frontend-action)

**Context:** Some repos have test-action.yml, others have ci.yml. Need to
consolidate to a single standard that supports both common tests and
repository-specific tests via repository-config.yml.

**Current State:**

- get-frontend-config-action: test-action.yml
- release-rust-action: ci.yml (with Rust-specific setup)
- release-frontend-action: ci.yml (with Node-specific setup)
- Others: Vary

**Action Items:**

- Validate README.md exists
- Run language-specific tests if applicable
- Execute action with sample inputs
- Must be repeatable across diverse action types

---

### #todo 5. Add release.yml to all action repos

**Status:** Not Started **Priority:** High **Templates:** [#file:release.yml]
(release-rust-action), [#file:release.yml] (release-frontend-action)

**Context:** All action repos need intelligent release workflows that create
semantic version tags, moving tags (v1, v1.0), and GitHub releases.

**Action Repos to Update:** Same as #todo 1

**Action Items:**

1. [ ] Review existing release.yml from release-rust-action and
       release-frontend-action
2. [ ] Create unified release.yml template supporting:
   - Trigger on version tags (v*.*.\*)
   - Manual workflow_dispatch with version input
   - Generate changelog from previous tag
   - Create GitHub Release with generated changelog
   - Update major.minor moving tags (v1 → v1.0 → v1.0.0)
   - Proper permissions (contents: write)
3. [ ] Deploy to all action repos
4. [ ] Test release workflow with sample version

**Template Reference:** [#file:release.yml] in release-rust-action and
release-frontend-action

**Key Requirements:**

- Determine version from tag or workflow_dispatch input
- Generate changelog between tags
- Create GitHub Release
- Update moving tags automatically

---

### #todo 6. Find and run repo settings script

**Status:** Research Phase **Priority:** High **Scripts:** sync-repo-setup.py,
others

**Context:** ghcommon should have a script to synchronize repository settings
(rebase-only merges, auto-delete branches, etc.) across repos. Need to find and
understand this script.

**Action Items:**

1. [ ] Locate the repo settings/sync script in ghcommon
2. [ ] Review script to understand:
   - What settings it modifies
   - How to configure target repos
   - Any prerequisites or dependencies
3. [ ] Document the settings it applies:
   - Rebase-only merge strategy
   - Auto-delete head branches on merge
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Dismiss stale reviews on new pushes
4. [ ] Run script against all action repos
5. [ ] Verify settings are applied correctly

**Script Search Results:**

- `sync-repo-setup.py` - Likely candidate for instructions/config sync
- `sync-github-labels.py` - Used for label sync
- Various sync-\*.py scripts in `.github/scripts/`

**Expected Findings:**

- Script should handle repository setup including merge strategy
- May use GitHub API for repository settings
- Should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
