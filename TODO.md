# TODO

## âœ… Completed

- [x] Phase 0: Shared workflow foundations (`workflow_common.py`, config schema, validation tooling,
      security checklist, core tests)
- [x] Phase 1: CI modernization (change detection helper, reusable CI workflow, feature-flagged
      caller, unit + integration tests)
- [x] Phase 2: Release consolidation (branch-aware release helper, reusable release workflow,
      feature-flagged caller, GitHub Packages docs/tests)
- [x] GitHub Packages publishing job, helper script, rollout docs, automated tests, and summary tooling
